App uses recommended data for clear cover as per IS 456 : 2000 that can be edited depending upon severity of the application. Similarly, one can edit bar diameter during analysis in order to satisfy percent steel and minimum number of bars that is recommended as per IS 456 : 2000. In addition each element has its own default dimensions that can be edited to suit the given application. Thus one can quickly build any application for onsite analysis as shown in screen shots.",

We will send our response as soon as possible along with possible updates fixing those run time exceptions. We can also work with you until issues are resolved. This is how we continuously improve with your help that benefits all users as well. We are committed for your complete satisfaction and your help and cooperation in this regard is highly appreciated."
